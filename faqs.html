        How long does the scent of a perfume last?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        The longevity of a perfume's scent varies depending on factors such as
        the concentration of fragrance oils, individual body chemistry, and the
        notes used in the perfume. Typically, perfumes can last anywhere from a
        few hours to several hours or even all day. Companies often provide
        information about the expected longevity of their perfumes, which can
        help customers choose the right product for their preferences.

      <button class="accordion">
        What is the difference between eau de parfum, eau de toilette, and eau
        de cologne?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        Eau de parfum typically has a higher concentration of fragrance oils,
        making it more long-lasting compared to eau de toilette or eau de
        cologne. Eau de toilette has a lighter concentration and is often used
        for everyday wear, while eau de cologne has an even lighter
        concentration and is typically associated with refreshing and
        citrus-based scents.

      <button class="accordion">
        How should I apply perfume for the best effect?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        It is recommended to apply perfume to pulse points, such as the wrists,
        neck, and behind the ears, as these areas generate heat and can enhance
        the fragrance's projection. Additionally, some experts suggest spraying
        the perfume from a slight distance and allowing it to settle on the skin
        rather than rubbing it in, as this can alter the scent.
